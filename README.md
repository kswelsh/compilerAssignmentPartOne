# compilerAssignmentPartOne

This assignment consists of developing the first step of a compiler â€“ the lexical analyzer, also called the scanner. 
The purpose of this program is to read in a source code file and create a corresponding token/lexeme file that represents the source code file.

Guidelines for this were given to us in CSCE 306 at North Central College.
